                    FUNCTIONS
Functions are a block of code that contains information about their operation.
They help me  alot by allowing me to not have to type the same code over and over.
They are also known as methods in some other programming languages.
They are reccognizable by the keyword def ('for define'), some name of my choice, and a set of parenthesis.
Once a function is defined, you can call (or invoke) them by typing the name of that function.

Example:
    # Function definition
    def print_hello():
        print( 'Hello, Everyone!' )
    # Function call.
    print_hello()

Inside the parentheses, you can insert pre-defined variables called arguments.
    Example:
        def print_hello(name):

I can even create a function with a default parameter.
Example:
    def print_hello(name="RM"):
        print( 'Hello', name, '!')
    #Function call
    print_hello()  # Will print 'Hello RM!' if left empty.
    print_hello('Rich')  # Will print 'Hello Rich' if not empty.




arguments, if used, must be in the correct order when the function is called.
Example:
    def intro(name, idn):
    print( 'Hello', name, '. Your ID is:', idn)

I can even create a function with a variable amount of arguments.
    Useful when I'm passing more arguments than I initially intended to  -- meaning that I don't initially have a clear qmount of arguments for your function yet.
Example:
    def print_nums(num, *more_num):
        print(num)
        for extra in more_num:  # more_num is a tuple, and therefore it can be left empty. This is why passing only the first arument will not print the other numbers.
            print(extra)
    nums(10)   # Will only print 10
    nums(10,20,30,40,50)   # Will print all the numbers


Best thing to remenber with functions:
    Try to keep it sinple.
    Functions only need to do one thing, and one thing only.
        If I need more things done, create another function to do it.
    If I have more arguments, make sure I use them in my function definition; and make sure I call my functions properly, with the right amount of arguments.
        Order of arguments matters!
