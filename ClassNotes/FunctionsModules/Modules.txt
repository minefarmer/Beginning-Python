                    Modules
Modules are files that contain Python code.
    These modules can define functions, classes, variables, or other runnable code.
Three ways to import modules into my code:
    'import' statements
    'from ... import' statement
    'from ... import *' statement

The 'import' statement allows me to import all classes, functions, and variables  from the imported Python file.
Example:
    import hello # Imported file would be 'hello.py' but I can omit the .py extension.
    hello.print_hello()  # This is how I access the import function.

The 'from ... import' statement allows you to import specific classes, functions, and variables from the imported Python file.
Example:
    from hello import print_hello  # Imported file would be 'hello.py'
    print_hello()  # I no longer need to call the module any more.

The'from ... import *' statement allows me to import everything from the imported Python file(module).
    from hello import *  # Imported file would be 'hello.py'.
It is not recommended to use it (the *(wild card)) Only use sparringly.
