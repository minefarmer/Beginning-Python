There are two types of scopes.
    Local
        Can be accessed only through the block of code through which it was defined.
    Global
        Can be accessed from anywhere within the code.
Example:
    total = 0
    def add_num(num_1, num_2):
        total = num_1 + num_2
        return total
    print(total)  # Prints the 'global' total.
    print(add_num(3,2))  # Prints the 'local' total.
